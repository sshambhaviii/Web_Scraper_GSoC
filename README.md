## Web_Scraper_GSoC
### Contents
- *gsoc2021.csv* : the csv file with scraped data
- *sitedata.html* : file containing complete html code of the GSoc page
- *webscraper.py* : python script used to obtain csv file
### Instructions
- The task was to create a python script file to scrap the [GSoc 2021](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/) page and obtain the required data in a csv file.
- The python library *requests-html* was used for this. Also, to read and write into the csv file, the *csv* library is also used.
- In order to run the code on our system, it is must that the required libraries are present. The libraries can be installed by running the pip install command.
- Also we need to ensure that the *html* file containing the sitedate, which we will be required to read and search for relevant tags, needs to be present in the same directory as the *python* file
